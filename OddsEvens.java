This is kinda my first real java program.
It is an Odds vs Evens game vs a random number generator (computer)

/*
NOTES:
+++ INPUT STUFF +++ 

`import java.util.Scanner`
  this imports the Scanner utility into the program to allow user input
  
`Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);`
  this creates a handle, "input" for me to use the scanner method
  I define input the handle
  
`String name = input.next();`
  this uses the scanner method to grab the input which is the next
  thing that is entered; it then assigns the input to the variable "name"

  Remember to decare the type of variable and also to declare the type
  of input expected with the .next; they should totally both match

  .nextInt();  .nextDouble();
  .nextLine(); <- this one will allow spaces as .next(); will not

+++ Random number generator +++
`(1 + (int)(Math.random() * 10))`

+++ How to compare strings again? +++
Interesting fact `==` means you are comparing memory addresses not values
That is why trying to compare two strings with `==` does not work

We need to use the String class method, `equals()`
eg: `value1.equals(value1)` then this returns a boolean value
